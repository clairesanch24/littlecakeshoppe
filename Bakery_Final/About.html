        <p4>My passion for baking started with an Easy Bake Oven. As a kid, I always loved helping my parents in the kitchen, either by weighing, cleaning or stirring the pot. But I wanted to feel like I could do more then just the basics- I wanted to feel like I could cook or bake something on my own. And when I saw this Easy Bake Oven in stores, the rest was history for me.</p4>

        <p4>After school, I would love to bake for my friends, school events and family. My parents always supported me with my baking, even wished that maybe one day I'd have my own shop. Once I graduated high school, knowing that my hobby could turn into a career, I signed up to a culinary school here in San Francisco.</p4>

      <p4>Throughout the years, I have loved the art of baking and have learned so much on my journey. I've been working from home baking cakes, cookies and cupcakes for events- or even if people just need some cake for breakfast! Nothing has made me more happy than to put a smile on peoples faces with cake.</p4>
