    <div class="header">My passion for baking started with an Easy Bake Oven. As a kid, ive always loved helping my parents in the kitchen. Either by weighing, cleaning or stirring the pot. But i wanted to feel like i could do more then just the basics, i wanted to feel like i could cook or bake something on my own. And when i saw this easy bake oven in stores, the rest was history for me.
        </div>
    <div class="body">After school, i would love to bake for my friends, school events and family. My parents always supported me on baking even wishing that maybe one day ill have my own shop. Ones i graduated high school, knowing that my hobby could turn into a career i signed up to a culinary school here in San Francisco.
